This excel spreadsheet has 3 tabs in it.

The first tab, called <b>Maturity Level</b>, gives a summary of your results.   To start with, all maturity levels are set to level 1.

The second tab, <B>VMMM questions</B>,  is where you need to answer the questions.   Each line has a question, and in column C, there is a pull down menu option to answer the question. 
Each question permits the value of No, Unknown, or Yes.   

Answer each question as honestly as you can about your organization.   

Each time a question is answered Yes, it will impact the associated maturity level on the <B>Maturity Level </B> tab. 

The third tab stores the pull down values. 

Suggestions welcome for changes/additions for improvements.
